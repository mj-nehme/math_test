# math_test

## This project is depricated and will be deleted soon. Please follow the [math_exam](https://github.com/mj-nehme/math_exam) project instead.

A math test prepared for my kids who are still in their elementary school.

This project is being built for learning purposes and will be watched and developed in my free time only.



## Description
The student can choose one exam out of six:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- One Variable Equation
- Two Variables Equation

The student has the option to choose the complexity level up to level 10.

An exam is made up of 10 questions, and so a score is calculated out of 10.

An exam can be either solved from the console (`cargo run`) or can be prepared in a pdf file (`cargo run -- pdf`)
