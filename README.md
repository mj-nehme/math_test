# math_test

A math test prepared for my kids who are still in their elementary school.

Current status: <span style="color:green"> **Running** </span>, but still a long way to be released ðŸš§.

This project is being built for learning purposes and will be watched and developed in my free time only.


## Description
The student can choose one exam out of six:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- One Variable Equation
- Two Variables Equation (unimplemented yet)

The student has the option to choose the complexity level up to level 10.

**An exam is made up of 10 questions, where the student should answer each within 10 secs. After the timeout, the answer is considered to be wrong.**

At the end, the score is calculated out of 10.


## Next steps (A contribution room):

Please read the [open issues](https://github.com/mj-nehme/math_test/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue).


## NOTE
The [math_test crate](https://crates.io/crates/math_test) would be frequently updated on major changes, but the [math_test github repo](https://github.com/mj-nehme/math_test) is to be updated on every (even minor) change.
