# math_test

A math test prepared for my kids who are still in their elementary school.

Current status: <span style="color:green"> **Running** </span>, but still no ready to be released ðŸš§. Follow the milestone "[Version 1](https://github.com/mj-nehme/math_test/milestone/1)" for more details.

This project is being built for learning purposes and will be watched and developed in my free time only.

## Description
The student can choose one exam out of six:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- One Variable Equation
- Two Variables Equation (unimplemented yet)

The student has the option to choose the complexity level up to level 10.

A test is made up of 10 questions, and so a score is calculated out of 10.

**Update**: Now, you have the option to prepare a pdf file (ready to be printed). `cargo run -- pdf`

## Next steps (A contribution room):

Please read the [open issues](https://github.com/mj-nehme/math_test/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue).


## NOTE
The [math_test crate](https://crates.io/crates/math_test) would be frequently updated on major changes, but the [math_test github repo](https://github.com/mj-nehme/math_test) is to be updated on every (even minor) change.
