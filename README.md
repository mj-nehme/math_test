# math_test

A math test prepared for my kids who are still in their elementary school.

**This project is under construction**

Next steps:
- Add documentation
- Make it accessible on other platforms that don't have the same CPU architecture. Either:
    - Transform to Wasm (Handle the needed changes to be convertible). And then embed it into some JS/HTML.
    - Add a RESTful API (most likely Actix).
- Perform the minor TODOs (mentioned in the code).
